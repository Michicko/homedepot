    text: "The Scandinavian-style interior is simple and light.\nThis is a bright and free space, solid and reliable pieces of furniture, cozy textiles and descreet decor. Designers use it not only for design of urban apartmnents, but also for surburban cottages. Extremely comfortable, but at the same time modest design - the hallmark of scandinavian style.\nThe minimalist style of Scandinavian design emerged during the 1930s within the five Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. It promoted simplistic ways of living.\nThe minimalist philosophy emphasized clean lines and simple designs that were inspired by nature and climate to create the Nordic design.\nIt promoted beautiful designs and quality, sustainable products that were affordable and easily accessible to people from all walks of life.",

    text: "There is simplicity in modern interior design that has given it everlasting relevance.\nModern homes have clean lines and are without fuss, yet they can be comfortable and cozy. A modernist aesthetic is not limited to a specific style since mid-century modern furniture is coveted in many homes with different style narratives.\nModern interior design is shaped by a heritage of clean lines, geometric form, clear spaces, function and storage. Below we explore some of the concepts behind modern design style, how to distinguish each approach and how to create the look in your own home.\nMinimalism provides a clear lifestyle for the homeowner to enjoy by creating a room in which every piece of furniture, shelf, cupboard or work of art has a distinct and necessary function within the space.\nWith its roots in modern interior design, form is also an essential element at play in minimalist interiors, pieces are chosen because they connect with each other, the space they are in and the exterior they look out and onto, altogether they provide the perfect edit of a calming aesthetic.",

    text: "Industrial interiors are defined by the architectural elements within a space. Other styles hide the piping and ductwork, but industrial embraces those elements, making them a focal point. Industrial interior design is raw, almost unfinished, providing a casual atmosphere that's relaxing to live in. By keeping the space practical and uncluttered, this style is welcoming and laidback.\nAt its core, the industrial style relies on incorporating building materials into the room. Exposed rafters, reclaimed wood, iron, brick, concrete, all are staples within this style. Spaces should have an open floorplan, like the factories they're inspired by. The room should be uncluttered, with a blend of clean straight lines as well as curved edges. Beyond those guidelines, there's flexibility to personalize the industrial style. The deconstructed look allows for more personalization as far as d√©cor goes.\nWe made this graphic that sums up the industrial interior characteristics.
